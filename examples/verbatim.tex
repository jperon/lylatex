\section*{Print LilyPond code}

The \texttt{verbatim} option causes the LilyPond code to be printed before the score.  The current issue is that the content of \texttt{\textbackslash lilypond} and the \texttt{lilypond} environment are passed as one line.

\lilypond[intertext=]{ c d e d }

\hrule

\textbf{NOTE:} The local \texttt{intertext} option doesn't work properly yet: it will only work when set to an empty string or to a single word. Setting it to a string enclosed in curly braces or quotation marks will make the option ignored.

\begin{lilypond}[intertext={This change of content does not have any effect}]
{
c d e d
}
\end{lilypond}

\hrule

\medskip
\renewcommand{\lyIntertext}[1]{

\textcolor{magenta}{#1}

\bigskip
}
The contents of included \emph{files} already work properly:

\lysetoption{intertext}{The formatting of the intertext be adjusted by renewing the command “lyIntertext”}

\lysetverbenv{\begin{minted}{TeX}}{\end{minted}}

\lilypondfile[intertext={This change of content does not have any effect}]{../ly/Sphinx/Sphinx}
